# Huawei Share – Hand Gesture Clone  
A modern, browser-based experiment that mimics Huawei Share but replaces device-tapping with **hand-gesture detection** using your webcam.

This tool is built for **newer computers only**.  
It requires **WebGL**, **hardware acceleration**, and a **working webcam**.  
Old PCs will not work.

## 🎥 Demonstration Video
This is only a **demo video**, not the actual tool:

Please watch it on a device that supports modern video playback.

## 🚀 What This Project Does
This is a rebuilt version of Huawei Share that works on **all device types**, without the original ecosystem restrictions.  
Instead of tapping phones or using NFC-like triggers, this version detects **specific hand gestures** to start the transfer action.

It runs entirely in the browser using:
- WebGL for rendering
- WebRTC for camera input
- ML models for gesture recognition

No installation required.

## 🖥️ System Requirements
### Must Have
- A **new computer** (laptop or desktop)
- A **webcam**
- A **modern browser** with WebGL enabled
- **GPU acceleration** ON

### Not Supported
- Old PCs without proper GPU support  
- Computers where WebGL is disabled or unavailable  
- Devices with no webcam  
- Underpowered systems that fail ML/GPU tasks  

If your browser reports **“WebGL not supported”**, the tool will not run.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Open the tool in a compatible browser.  
2. Grant **camera access**.  
3. The system tracks your hand in real time.  
4. When your gesture matches a pre-defined pattern, the system triggers a **transfer event**, similar to Huawei Share’s action.

This is a **demo-level** prototype—showcasing the concept rather than providing full file transfer functionality.
